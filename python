z score= (value picked - μ) / σ

Where μ is the mean and σ is standard deviation of the Normal Distribution

This formula can be coded in Python (in Python 3 Trinket) so that we can calculate z score of any value.
 
mean_normal_dist = 75
stddev_normal_dist = 7.5
value_picked = 81.2

z_score = (value_picked - mean_normal_dist) / stddev_normal_dist
print ("The z-score is:", z_score)
